ACEFA aims to support the timely, effective response to epidemic diseases in Australia through real-time data analytics, modelling, and forecasting. Our work builds on a national seasonal influenza forecasting program (2014–19) and [COVID-19 situational assessment consortium (2020–23)](https://doi.org/10.26188/24845328.v1).
