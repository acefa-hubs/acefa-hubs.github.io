## Scenario Modelling Pilot Exercise 2025–26

Australian and New Zealand public health partners are interested in assessing the potential population impact of a school-based seasonal influenza immunisation program, using an intranasally delivered live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV).

**Modelling question:** What are the potential health impacts of a school-based live attenuated influenza vaccination (LAIV) program?

**Goals of the pilot exercise:** 

1.	Provide evidence to support decision-making on the implementation of a school-based LAIV program.  

2.	Establish processes and relationships for multi-model scenario modelling and comparison exercises in Australia and New Zealand, enhancing epidemic preparedness and response.  


Modelling teams are investigating the potential impact of six LAIV scenarios (B–G) compared to a baseline scenario (A, standard inactivated influenza vaccine administered to all ages).
