Enhancing collaboration at the science-policy interface to support state, national, and regional public health decision-making is a core goal for ACEFA. 

ACEFA is establishing processes for wider collaboration and participation, particularly through our Winter Situational Assessment Program (including the Forecasting Hub) and Scenario Modelling Hub.
