The participation of modellers/analysts (who specialise in epidemic dynamics and prediction) in surveillance planning is important to ensure that the most impactful data are collected for epidemic monitoring and response.

ACEFA is working to optimise the design of disease surveillance to maximise the information gained from public health data while minimising surveillance resources.
