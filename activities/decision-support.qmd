ACEFA has two active programs related to decision support:

[Annual Winter Situational Assessment Program 2025](winter-assessment.qmd) – predicting past, current, and short-term future trends in epidemic dynamics to support immediate public health responses. 

[Scenario Modelling Hub 2025](scenario-modelling.qmd) – projecting the impact of different intervention scenarios over multi-month or multi-year time horizons to support medium- to long-term public health decisions.
