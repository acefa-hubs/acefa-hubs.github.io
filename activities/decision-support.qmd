## Annual Winter Situational Assessment Program 

The clinical burden from acute viral respiratory infections during winter months will often be the result of multiple concurrent epidemics. 
In temperate regions, many countries experienced overlapping epidemics of influenza, RSV and COVID-19, exerting unusual pressure on ICU capacity during winter months. 
Short-term forecasting of epidemic activity can help to enable rapid understanding of the status of concurrent epidemics and preparation for any increased impact on healthcare services.

The project has the following aims:

1. To generate real-time epidemic analysis, including forecasts, of COVID-19, influenza, and RSV during winter to support public health risk assessment and response.

2. To develop enhanced methods for epidemic situational assessment of viral respiratory pathogens.

3. To assess forecast utility and public health value through both statistical performance evaluation and engagement with public health partners.

## Scenario Hub modelling

The purpose of the Scenario Modelling Hub is to provide robust model-based evidence to support medium to long-term infectious disease management decisions.

Multiple research groups within the ACEFA network independently model the future health impact of different intervention scenarios. Groups produce the same set of projections to allow the comparison and synthesis of outputs across models.

## Scenario Modelling Pilot Exercise 2025–26

Australian and New Zealand public health partners are interested in assessing the potential population impact of a school-based seasonal influenza immunisation program, using an intranasally delivered live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV).

**Modelling question:** What are the potential health impacts of a school-based live attenuated influenza vaccination (LAIV) program?

**Goals of the pilot exercise:** 

1.	Provide evidence to support decision-making on the implementation of a school-based LAIV program.  

2.	Establish processes and relationships for multi-model scenario modelling and comparison exercises in Australia and New Zealand, enhancing epidemic preparedness and response.  


Modelling teams are investigating the potential impact of six LAIV scenarios (B–G) compared to a baseline scenario (A, standard inactivated influenza vaccine administered to all ages).
