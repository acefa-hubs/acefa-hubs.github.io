## Annual Winter Situational Assessment Program 

The clinical burden from acute viral respiratory infections during winter months will often be the result of multiple concurrent epidemics. 
In winter, many countries experienced large overlapping epidemics of influenza, RSV and COVID-19, exerting unusual pressure on ICU capacity. 
Short-term forecasting of epidemic activity can help to enable rapid understanding of the status of concurrent epidemics and preparation for any increased impact on healthcare services.

The project has the following aims:

1. To develop enhanced methods for epidemic situational assessment of viral respiratory pathogens.

2. To generate real-time epidemic analysis, including forecasts, of COVID-19, influenza, and RSV during winter to support public health risk assessment and response.

3. To assess forecast utility and public health value through both statistical performance evaluation and engagement with public health partners.

## Scenario Hub modelling for 2025-26

ACEFA launched the Australia-Aotearoa Scenario Modelling Hub in April 2025 and through 2025 will coordinate a pilot Scenario Modelling Exercise, in which multiple research groups within the ACEFA network independently model the future population-level health impact of a school-based influenza immunisation program. Throughout the year, groups will collaborate on data interpretation, parameterisation, and scenario design. Groups will independently produce the same set of projections to allow the comparison and synthesis of outputs across models. This will be the first multi-model scenario analysis exercise conducted in Australia for infectious disease policy.
