ACEFA works to advance methods and software tools for epidemic analysis, forecasting, and scenario modelling, drawing on multiple data sources. We have established a Community of Practice to support the development and application of new methods, open-source research software tools, and knowledge for:

- Understanding the state of an epidemic and predicting its future course, including the potential for public health measures to reduce disease burden. 

- Risk assessment and early characterisation of emerging and resurgent epidemic disease threats.  

- Optimal study designs and indicators for infectious disease surveillance.
