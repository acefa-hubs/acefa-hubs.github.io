Achieving public health goals and addressing emerging diseases requires advanced epidemic analytic methods.

ACEFA works to advance methods and software tools for epidemic analysis, forecasting, and scenario modelling, drawing on multiple data sources. We have established a Community of Practice to support the development and application of new methods, open-source research software tools, and knowledge for:

- Understanding the state of an epidemic and predicting its future course, including the potential for public health measures to reduce disease burden. 

- Risk assessment and early characterisation of emerging and resurgent epidemic disease threats.  

- Optimal study designs and indicators for infectious disease surveillance.
